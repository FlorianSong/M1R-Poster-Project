# M1R-Poster-Project

During summer term of 2014, I undertook an Individual Poster Project as part of my BSc in Mathematics. 
This repository collects all scripts written during the project, as well as the final outcome, a poster entitled *Darwinian selection in a Boolean network*. 
Click [here](poster/M1RposterL.pdf) to see the poster. 

This work was mainly based on Eriksson, D. & Jensen, H. J. Darwinian selection in a locally unstable Boolean network. J. Stat. Mech. Theory Exp. 2004, P09001 (2004). DOI: [10.1088/1742-5468/2004/09/P09001](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2004/09/P09001)
